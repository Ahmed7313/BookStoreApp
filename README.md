This is the Final App I have created for Android Basics NanoDegree by Google.

The goal is to design and create the structure of an **Inventory App** which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory.

**This is how the App looks like:**

The App includes it's own **QueryUtils** class that handles connecting the **App** to the **API** and parsing the received **Data** in **JSONobjects** and **JSONArrays**.

Its also includes a preference sitting layout that allows the user to choose the types of articles he wants to receive 

**This is how the App looks like:**

# The goal of this project was to learn:

-   Storing information in a SQLite database
-   Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
-   Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
-   Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
-   Updating information based on user input
-   Creating intents to other apps using stored information

# I have created and used through this project:

 1. **ContractClass**
  
2. **ContentProvider**

3. **SQLiteOpenHelper**

4. **UriMatcher**

5. **Cursor**

6. **CursorAdapter**

7. **CursorLoader**

8. **Menu Items**

9. **AlertDialog.Builder**

10. **DialogInterface** 

11. **SQLight database**

12. **Best OOP  design practices**
